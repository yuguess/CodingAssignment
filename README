====Column Diff====
dev environment:
  Fedora 17, gcc 4.7 with c++0x

design logic: 
  1. I use C-style file functions (fgets, fprintf) to process the file, instead of 
     cin and cout, since cin use inherit mechinism within implementtaion whick make it 
     very slow when processing large files. Using fgets instead of fscanf is to avoid
     potential buffer overflow bug.

  2. To add flexibility to my program, I use "function" object map to get diff function 
     between differe type pairs. For example, diff between int and int can be fetched 
     by using key "intDiffInt" and "strDiffStr" for diff between 2 string types, 
     I could have made it more object-orientate style by writing a virtual class, 
     that will an elegant program looks cumbersome 

  3. Each "diff" function is like "addon" to this program, To support maximum 
     flexiblity, user can define its own diff function by applying function signiture
     int strDiffStr(std::string &l, std::string &r, std::string &res)
     after implementing this function, user need to regsiter this addon by calling. 
     registerDiffType(key, funcName). For example, to get diff between int and date,
     user can implement its own function and register with "intDate". Another option is to
     overload operator with template argument, again, my intenstion is to 
      
  4. I use char "_" to separate column type, each value is no more that 255 characater 
     in length. The empty line will be skiped in file. 

how to compile, run and test:
  0. use make to compile
  1. use ./colDiff input1 input2 output 
  2. testcase dir contain serveral testcases

possible improvement:
  1. Add more test caes to test the corner and extreme cases.
  2. Add XML config to define which diff function currently support in this program, load 
     each addon function without re-compile the program.
